# Py-Projects

A collection of Python projects I've completed focused on simulation - namely, stochastic processes and physical models.

These projects were particularly instrumental in becoming comfortable with "Pythonic" code (i.e. exploiting Python's high level capabilities) to recreate complex physical models in relatively few lines of code.
