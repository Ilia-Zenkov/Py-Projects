# The Monty Hall Problem


You're on a game show. There are three doors, behind one of which is a prize, while behind the other two is not a prize.
The host asks us to pick 1 of the 3 doors. The contents of our chosen door are not revealed, but one of the prize-less bum doors are revealed.
We are offered to stick with or change our choice of door (the prize door being either the one we picked, or the other still-closed door)
All doors open and we either win or lose - the probability of which depends on our strategy.
Should we switch doors when offered? The answer is yes. 

The Monty Hall Problem was conceived and solved by Steve Selvin in 1975.
Many mathematicians have (reportedly) had a difficult time grasping the intuition to this problem.
The problem was submitted to a magazine in 1990 - which garnered thousands of letters from Ph. D holders disagreeing with the solution.
Most famously, Paul Erd≈ës - perhaps the most prolific mathematician of all time - was not convinced until he was shown a computer simulated run of the problem in 1999, confirming switching to be the correct choice.

The 'solution' to the Monty Hall Problem is to always switch doors. We will then always win with a 2/3 chance, vs a 1/3 chance if we had not switched. 
The answer to this problem is unintuitive - should it not be 50/50 when we are left to pick between two doors, behind one of which is a prize?

The key insight to this problem is that we are not choosing between two doors, behind one of which is a prize. 
Instead, we have switched choice from the first door - which has added probabilistic value to the second door.
