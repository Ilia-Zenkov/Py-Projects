# Pendulums and Chaotic Motion

In this project I use Python's SciPy library to calculate the trajectory of simple pendula.

Then, I use the pendula system to demonstrate chaotic motion: The pendula systems apparently-random states of disorder and irregularities are in fact governed by deterministic physical laws of motion that are highly sensitive to initial condition. I accomplish this by varying slightly the driving frequencies of two different pendula and plotting the difference in their trajectories.
